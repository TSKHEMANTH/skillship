//Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer Mapping
/*Given a string s formed by digits ('0' - '9') and '#' . We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:

Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively. 
Return the string formed after mapping.

It's guaranteed that a unique mapping will always exist.*/

//getting address sanitizer issue while running the program in leetcode..but while doing in C-online compiler, the program is successful..
