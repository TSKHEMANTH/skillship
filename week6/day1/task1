//Happy and Sets
/*Once Happy was playing with his friends during his maths class. Seeing this, his teacher asked him to solve a problem. The teacher gave him a set of n positive integers and asked him to tell the sum of the product of elements of all the possible subsets.

For e.g. Say, the teacher gave him a set {2, 3, 5}. The possible subsets of this set are {2}, {3}, {5}, {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 5} and {2, 3, 5}. So Happy should report the answer as the sum of 2, 3, 5, 6 (2 * 3),  (2 * 5),  (3 * 5) and  (2 * 3 * 5) i.e.,  to the teacher.

As the output of the problem can be large, so the teacher asked happy to report the answer modulo 1000000007.*/

	scanf("%d", &num);              			// Reading input from STDIN
	printf("Input number is %d.\n", num);       // Writing output to STDOUT

	scanf("%lld",&n);
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		scanf("%lld",&a);
		prod=(prod*(a+1))%mod;
	}
	long long int ans;
	ans=prod-1;
	printf("%lld",ans);
	return 0;
